# Screenplay Scripts for the InfoRapid KnowledgeBase Builder
The KnowledgeBase Builder can be automated by running screenplay scripts. You can start them by choosing "Run Script" in the "Edit Diagram" panel. These scripts can do all the things that a user can do manually in the KnowledgeBase Builder and they can speak text with the integrated Text to Speech engine.
