# Screenplay Scripts for the InfoRapid KnowledgeBase Builder
The KnowledgeBase Builder can be automated by running screenplay scripts. To start them, simply select "Run Script" in the "Edit Diagram" panel. These scripts are capable of performing all the actions that a user can manually do in the KnowledgeBase Builder, and they can also speak text using the integrated Text to Speech engine. I use these screenplay scripts to generate my YouTube videos. For the best results, I recommend using the free online version of the KnowledgeBase Builder in the Microsoft Edge Browser, as it seems to have the most naturally sounding text to speech engine.
